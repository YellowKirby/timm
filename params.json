{"name":"Timm","tagline":"Immutability helpers with fast reads and acceptable writes","body":"# timm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guigrpa/timm.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/guigrpa/timm) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/timm.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timm)\r\nImmutability helpers with fast reads and acceptable writes\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install --save timm\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI know, I know... the world does not need yet another immutability library, especially with the likes of [ImmutableJS](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and [seamless-immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable) around. \r\n\r\nAnd yet... I felt the urge, at least just to cover my limited needs. ImmutableJS is a solid, comprehensive and highly-performant solution, but this power comes at a price: mixing up ImmutableJS's Maps and Lists with your plain objects can cause some friction, and reading those objects (in my case, more often than writing them) is not that convenient.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, seamless-immutable solves the \"friction\" problem by using plain objects and arrays, but seems to have some performance issues (at least in my benchmarks, see below).\r\n\r\nTimm's approach: use plain objects and arrays and provide simple mutation functions that will probably not handle all edge cases. It is by no means a complete solution, but it covers 100% of my use cases and maybe 90% of yours, too. Suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\nI prepared an initial benchmarking tool comparing read/write speeds in four cases:\r\n\r\n* In-place editing (mutable)\r\n* ImmutableJS\r\n* Seamless-immutable\r\n* Timm\r\n\r\nAll four solutions are first verified for consistency (the mutable solution obviously does not pass all tests) and then benchmarked. Benchmarks cover reading and writing object attributes at different nesting levels (root level, 2 levels and 5 levels deep). They do not cover arrays for the moment (coming up!).\r\n\r\nFeel free to run them yourself (download the repo and then `npm install && npm run benchmarks`). These are my results on a Windows machine for 200k iterations:\r\n\r\n![Benchmarks](https://github.com/guigrpa/timm/blob/master/docs/benchmarks-win7-20160218.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nReads are roughly on par with native objects/arrays and seamless-immutable, and faster than ImmutableJS (the deeper, the faster). Writes are much slower than in-place edits, as expected, but are much faster than seamless-immutable (even in production mode). Write performance is somewhat comparable to ImmutableJS's, at least for deep writes. Shallower writes are slower, but in the same order of magnitude.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Arrays\r\n\r\n#### addLast()\r\nReturns a new array with an appended item.\r\n\r\nUsage: `addLast(array: Array, val: any): Array`\r\n\r\n```js\r\narr = ['a', 'b']\r\narr2 = addLast(arr, 'c')\r\n// [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]\r\narr2 === arr\r\n// false\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### addFirst()\r\nReturns a new array with a prepended item.\r\n\r\nUsage: `addFirst(array: Array, val: any): Array`\r\n\r\n```js\r\narr = ['a', 'b']\r\narr2 = addFirst(arr, 'c')\r\n// [ 'c', 'a', 'b' ]\r\narr2 === arr\r\n// false\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### removeAt()\r\nReturns a new array obtained by removing an item at\r\na specified index.\r\n\r\nUsage: `removeAt(array: Array, idx: number): Array`\r\n\r\n```js\r\narr = ['a', 'b', 'c']\r\narr2 = removeAt(arr, 1)\r\n// [ 'a', 'c' ]\r\narr2 === arr\r\n// false\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### replaceAt()\r\nReturns a new array obtained by replacing an item at\r\na specified index. If the provided item is the same\r\n(*referentially equal to*) the previous item at that position,\r\nthe original array is returned.\r\n\r\nUsage: `replaceAt(array: Array, idx: number, newItem: any): Array`\r\n\r\n```js\r\narr = ['a', 'b', 'c']\r\narr2 = replaceAt(arr, 1, 'd')\r\n// [ 'a', 'd', 'c' ]\r\narr2 === arr\r\n// false\r\nreplaceAt(arr, 1, 'b') === arr\r\n// true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Objects\r\n\r\n#### set()\r\nReturns a new object with a modified attribute.\r\nIf the provided value is the same (*referentially equal to*)\r\nthe previous value, the original object is returned.\r\n\r\nUsage: `set(obj: Object, key: string, val: any): Object`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nobj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}\r\nobj2 = set(obj, 'b', 5)\r\n// { a: 1, b: 5, c: 3 }\r\nobj2 === obj\r\n// false\r\nset(obj, 'b', 2) === obj\r\n// true\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### setIn()\r\nReturns a new object with a modified **nested** attribute.\r\n\r\nUsage: `setIn(obj: Object, path: Array<string>, val: any): Object`\r\nIf the provided value is the same (*referentially equal to*)\r\nthe previous value, the original object is returned.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nobj = {a: 1, b: 2, d: {d1: 3, d2: 4}, e: {e1: 'foo', e2: 'bar'}}\r\nobj2 = setIn(obj, ['d', 'd1'], 4)\r\n// { a: 1, b: 2, d: { d1: 4, d2: 4 }, e: { e1: 'foo', e2: 'bar' } }\r\nobj2 === obj\r\n// false\r\nobj2.d === obj.d\r\n// false\r\nobj2.e === obj.e\r\n// true\r\nobj3 = setIn(obj, ['d', 'd1'], 3)\r\n// { a: 1, b: 2, d: { d1: 3, d2: 4 }, e: { e1: 'foo', e2: 'bar' } }\r\nobj3 === obj\r\n// true\r\nobj3.d === obj.d\r\n// true\r\nobj3.e === obj.e\r\n// true\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### merge()\r\nReturns a new object built as follows: the overlapping keys from the\r\nsecond one overwrite the corresponding entries from the first one.\r\nSimilar to `Object.assign()`, but immutable.\r\n\r\nUsage: `merge(obj1: Object, obj2: Object): Object`\r\n\r\nThe unmodified `obj1` is returned if `obj2` does not *provide something\r\nnew to* `obj1`, i.e. if either of the following\r\nconditions are true:\r\n\r\n* `obj2` is `null` or `undefined`\r\n* `obj2` is an object, but it is empty\r\n* All attributes of `obj2` are referentially equal to the\r\n  corresponding attributes of `obj`\r\n\r\n#### addDefaults()\r\nReturns a new object built as follows: undefined keys in the first one\r\nare filled in with the corresponding values from the second one.\r\nSimilar to underscore's `defaults()` function, but immutable.\r\n\r\nUsage: `merge(obj: Object, defaults: Object): Object`\r\n\r\n\r\n## MIT license\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) [Guillermo Grau Panea](https://github.com/guigrpa) 2016\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
